# Multi-access edge computing(MEC)
Multi-access edge computing is a development of Mobile edge computing, and provided a new solution to converge IT services and telecommunication at the edge of network.
However, diffierent with Mobile edge computing, Multi-access edge computing can creat cloud platform nearby Base station and get closer to end devices.
Hence, the main advantage of MEC is ultra-low latency which meets the requirement of 5G and becomes an essential technology for next generation communication.
## Application
* Internet of Thing(IoT) and Big Data   
MEC provides more cloud platform nearby end devices which can save more data, and low latency make signal transmission of IoT easier and more efficient.
* Smart City and Industry 4.0   
Smart City include several services such as energy saving, Video analyze and monitoring, traffic control. These Services require a huge amount of data and MEC can storge data.
* Autonomous Car   
According to MEC server nearby each BS vehicle can adjust its moving angle and receive traffic congestion information.
## MEC enabling Technology  
* Software DeÔ¨Åned Network(SDR)

* Network Function Virtualization(NFV)
* Network slicing
## challenges
*  UE Mobility
* Security and Privacy
## MEC Structure
