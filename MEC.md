# Multi-access edge computing(MEC)
Multi-access edge computing is a development of Mobile edge computing, and provided a new solution to converge IT services and telecommunication at the edge of network.
However, diffierent with Mobile edge computing, Multi-access edge computing can creat cloud platform nearby Base station and get closer to end devices.
Hence, the main advantage of MEC is ultra-low latency which meets the requirement of 5G and becomes an essential technology for next generation communication.
